# Habits

Application developed during the NLW week, offered by [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/).

I followed the front-end and back-end parts, where I can have my first contact with react.

The application developed was intended to generate a control flow of daily habits, where we can register new ones and monitor them.
